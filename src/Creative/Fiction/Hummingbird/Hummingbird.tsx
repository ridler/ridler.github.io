          The hummingbird crashed hard into the window. It was looking for
          nectar, but found unyeilding glass. I stood above it as it twiched on
          the ground. It was heartbreaking to see such an energetic spirit in
          that wounded state. I wondered if putting it out of its misery would
          be the kind and merciful thing to do, when suddenly it sprung to life
          and flew away! Filled with hope, I turned around and sprinted
          headfirst into a wall.

          As winter intensified, the hummingbird struggled to find nectar. The
          vibrant flowers of summer were now withered and brown. One snowy
          evening, the hummingbird saw a massive wall of vivid color. He flew
          closer with the taste of sweet nectar on his mind. Once he was close
          enough to truly see the wall, it was apparent that it contained no
          actual life or nectar. It was only bright light depicting such things.
          The hummingbird knew the flat images weren't truly what he needed, but
          the projection was convincing enough to satisfy him for a moment. A
          moment became several, and his once-rapid wings slowed down, absent of
          the fuel that real nectar brought. An idea struck the tired
          hummingbird: If he could simply watch the projection, there was no
          need to fly up to it as if he was going to drink real nectar. He flew
          down to a comfortable perch and stared at the wall for a while longer,
          motionless.
