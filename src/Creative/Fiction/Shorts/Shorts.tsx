          <p>The gate is unkept and wide open,</p>
          <p>but who in their right mind would pass through</p>
          <p>when the other side is unknown and uncomfortable?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>One day we'll all pass through the gate,</p>
          <p>each of us defined by the terrain we avoided,</p>
          <p>the terrain we conquered and confronted.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As I hurdle toward the gate of oblivion,</p>
          <p>I wonder where freedom lies.</p>
          <p>Can I control the winds which whisk me toward the gate?</p>
          <p>Or is freedom found in forfeit?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Perhaps freedom is which gates we pass through,</p>
          <p>and which we avoid,</p>
          <p>each of us morally justified in our own eyes;</p>
          <p>condemned in the eyes of others.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With unyielding wind at our backs,</p>
          <p>I see some dig their fingernails into the posts of the gates,</p>
          <p>fighting desperately for control, for comfort, for stagnation.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Surrender to the wind,</p>
          <p>parasail through the gates,</p>
          <p>deaf to the cries of the virtuous post-grabbers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>(You already know though, that's the motto: YOLO)</p>

          <p>I climbed up this mountain looking down.</p>
          <p>Everything was beneath me.</p>
          <p>I was above it all.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ascending the forested slopes,</p>
          <p>I was critical, cynical and sad.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I reached a ridge where the trees stopped growing,</p>
          <p>And set down the luggage I was towing.</p>
          <p>Smugly proud of my endurance and strength,</p>
          <p>My feet and legs were far above average.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I finally looked up, and saw the summit still far above me.</p>
          <p>Humbled, I realized I would never reach the peak.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Beyond my perch were even higher peaks.</p>
          <p>Were greater athletes on their summits?</p>
          <p>Looking down at the ridge I was on?</p>
          <p>Looking down on me?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I imagined how exhausted they must be.</p>
          <p>I realized how exhausted I was.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I turned my gaze toward the base</p>
          <p>And saw the town I came from:</p>
          <p>The town to which I had to return.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I thought about how nice it was to even have the time...</p>
          <p>To think such a thought,</p>
          <p>In such a place,</p>
          <p>With such a view.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I left my luggage on that ledge.</p>
          <p>Lighter, I headed down,</p>
          <p>Stoked to simply slide on the snow</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>All the way:</p>
          <p>Finding joy in things that were juvenile,</p>
          <p>Easily impressed by the imperfect,</p>
          <p>Finding bliss in the benign.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Taking in the view, I found a new mood:</p>
          <p>One of generosity and gratitude.</p>
