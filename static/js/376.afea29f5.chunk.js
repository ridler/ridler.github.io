The vibrant flowers of summer were now withered and brown. One snowy evening, the hummingbird saw a massive wall of vivid color. He flew closer with the taste of sweet nectar on his mind. Once he was close enough to truly see the wall, it was apparent that it contained no actual life or nectar. It was only bright light depicting such things. The hummingbird knew the flat images weren't truly what he needed, but the projection was convincing enough to satisfy him for a moment. A moment became several, and his once-rapid wings slowed down, absent of the fuel that real nectar brought. An idea struck the tired hummingbird: If he could simply watch the projection, there was no need to fly up to it as if he was going to drink real nectar. He flew down to a comfortable perch and stared at the wall for a while longer, motionless."})]})]})}},200:(e,t,i)=>{e.exports=i.p+"static/media/HummingbirdStadium.cd5ec52e17f908684e78.jpg"},195:(e,t,i)=>{e.exports=i.p+"static/media/HummingbirdWindow.5b21ee438cc7886beb80.jpg"}}]);
