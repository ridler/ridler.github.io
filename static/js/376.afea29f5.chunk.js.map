It was looking for\n          nectar, but found unyeilding glass. I stood above it as it twiched on\n          the ground. It was heartbreaking to see such an energetic spirit in\n          that wounded state. I wondered if putting it out of its misery would\n          be the kind and merciful thing to do, when suddenly it sprung to life\n          and flew away! Filled with hope, I turned around and sprinted\n          headfirst into a wall.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <img\n          alt=\"\"\n          className=\"image-with-aspect\"\n          src={require(\"./HummingbirdStadium.jpg\")}\n        />\n        <p className=\"tw-mt-3\">\n          As winter intensified, the hummingbird struggled to find nectar. The\n          vibrant flowers of summer were now withered and brown. One snowy\n          evening, the hummingbird saw a massive wall of vivid color. He flew\n          closer with the taste of sweet nectar on his mind. Once he was close\n          enough to truly see the wall, it was apparent that it contained no\n          actual life or nectar. It was only bright light depicting such things.\n          The hummingbird knew the flat images weren't truly what he needed, but\n          the projection was convincing enough to satisfy him for a moment. A\n          moment became several, and his once-rapid wings slowed down, absent of\n          the fuel that real nectar brought. An idea struck the tired\n          hummingbird: If he could simply watch the projection, there was no\n          need to fly up to it as if he was going to drink real nectar. He flew\n          down to a comfortable perch and stared at the wall for a while longer,\n          motionless.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["Hummingbird","_jsxs","children","_jsx","className","alt","src","require"],"sourceRoot":""}
